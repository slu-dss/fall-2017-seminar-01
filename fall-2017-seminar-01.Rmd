## R and RStudio Basics

R is a programming language that is highly extensible and flexible - it can be adpated to work with everything from textual data to statistical and spatial data. [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) is a user interface for R that makes working with the language *much* easier. The first three features below that we'll discuss briefly are all aspects of RStudio - they are not part of the basic R releases.

### R Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert* button on the toolbar and choosing `R`.

When you save the notebook, an `html` file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the `html` file). The `html` file will always be saved in the directory that your R Markdown file is saved in.

If you want to create a new R Notebook, you can do so by going to `File > New File > R Notebook`.

### R Markdown
All of the writing in this document uses [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) syntax. We use Markdown because it is simple to learn and allows us to work in plain text files so we aren't dependent on proprietary (and expensive!) software. RStudio can render Markdown into various formats like `html` and `pdf`.

The pair of brackets matched with the pair of paraentheses in the previous paragraph is how we hyperlink references. You won't see the url when the text is renderd - the text "R Markdown" will be a hyperlink that you can click on.

We use the number sign for headings where one number sign is the highest level heading and six number signs are the lowest level headings. 

*This is italicized text*, **this is bold text**, and `this is text in a typewriter font`. We use the `typewriter font` to refer to file and variable names.

* We 
* can
* also
* make
* bulleted
* lists.

### R Projects

R projects create a home for your analyses. When you set a R project up, it will change the **working directory** to the project's directory. This means that all of the data you save from RStudio will be saved there by default. It also means that you can open files saved in that directory without needing to worry about file paths. 

We'll give you an R project directory to download for each seminar session. However, if you want to create a new project for your own work, go to `File > New Project...` and follow the prompts. You can create a new project directory, associate a project with an existing directory, and even add `git` version control if you know how to use it!

### R Packages

Packages are the way that we can extend the base R software. They are typically written by R users and made available for free via a series of servers called CRAN.

To install new packages, we use the `install.packages()` function where the package name is written inside the parantheses in double quotes - "package name". For the "tidyverse" package, the installation function would look like this:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

We'll also need a package called "devtools". Try writing out the installation script for that:

```{r}

```

Finally, we'll need a package called "stlData" that is installed from a non-CRAN source:

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("chris-prener/stlData")
```

The [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) is actually a family of packages for R that share a philosophy on how data analysis *should* be done (they're very opinionated!). We're going to use a couple of those packages today. One of those is the `dplyr` package. We need to load packages explicity like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Now, try loading the `ggplot2` package (for graphing) and the `stlData` package, which contains two data frames with the data we'll use today:

```{r}


```

### Getting Help

You can prefice packages or specific functions with a question mark to get specific help files:

```{r}
?stlData
```

For our session data on health insurance in St. Louis:

```{r}
?stlInsurance
```

Try getting the help file for our other session dataset, blood lead level test results for kids in St. Louis:

```{r}

```

## Opening and Exploring Data in RStudio

### Opening Data

First, we'll want to load both of our data sets into R's memory. We do this by assigning the data in the `stlData` package to *objects*. For instance, we can take the data from the table `stlInsurance` and assign it to an object named `insurance` by using the assignment operator (`<-`):

```{r}
insurance <- stlInsurance
```

Now try assigning the data from the table `stlLead` to an object named `lead`:

```{r}

```

### Exploring Values

There are a number of ways that we can explore our data. We can use the `View()` function to open up a spreadsheet-like view of our data:

```{r}
View(insurance)
```

Try this for the `lead` data:

```{r}

```

We can also use the `str()` function (the "structure" function) to get a list of all variables present in our data frame:

```{r}
str(insurance)
```

Try this for the `lead` data:

```{r}

```

The `summary` command gives us descriptive statistics, such as range, mean, median, etc. This can be used for a specific variable or an entire dataset. 

```{r}
summary(insurance$pctUnins)
summary(insurance)
```

Now try the `summary` command with the `pctElevated` variable in the `lead` dataframe, which shows the percent of children tested in each datapoint that had elevated lead levels. Also try it with the full `lead` dataframe.

```{r}


```

## Basic plots with `ggplot2`

R offers many ways of making sophisticated plots, including the package `ggplot2`. We will use this package (already loaded as part of `tidy verse`) to makes some plots without worrying too much about the syntax of the commands. For more information on `ggplot2`, see Wickham (2015). 

### Histograms

The basic `ggplot` call requires the assignment of a dataframe ('insurance') and an aesthetic variable to an object named `pctUnins`. The second line also calls the specific type of plot we want to make as a "geom". In this case, we'll use the `geom_histogram()`. The `binwidth = val` can be adapted as needed to adjust the appearance of the plot. Note that we call the object `pctUnins` afterwards to display it.

```{r}
pctUnins <- ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = insurance, aes(x=pctUnins), binwidth = 2)
pctUnins
```

Now try making a histogram for the `pctElevated` variable in the `lead` dataframe. 

```{r}



```


### Saving plots 

To save the plots we have made, we can use the function `ggsave`, which will save the plot to our working directory. First specify the object name ('pctUnins') and then after 'file' specify the file name and type.

```{r}
ggsave(pctUnins, file = "pctUnins histogram.png")
```
